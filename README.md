This repository hosts a **Savings Calculator & AI Impact Analyzer** to help you understand exactly how much money and SEO authority you are losing to spam bots, and provides the best link to solve it.

## 🧮 The Hidden Cost of Spam (The Formula)

Many website owners think manual moderation is "free." It is not. It costs you valuable time that should be spent growing your business.

We use the following **Productivity Loss Formula** to calculate the real cost:

```math
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        THE SPAM COST FORMULA                           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                        │
│   ( Spam_Items_Per_Day  ×  Minutes_To_Moderate )  ×  Hourly_Wage       │
│                                                                        │
│   =  💰 MONEY WASTED PER DAY                                           │
│                                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 💡 Real World Example:
If you receive **20 spam comments** a day, and it takes **2 minutes** to review/delete each one (checking IP, reading content), and your time is worth **$30/hour**:

1.  **Time Lost:** 20 × 2 = 40 minutes/day.
2.  **Annual Time:** 40 mins × 365 days = **243 Hours/Year**.
3.  **Money Lost:** 243 hours × $30 = **$7,290 Wasted**.

**The Solution:** [CleanTalk costs roughly $8-$12/year](https://cleantalk.org/?pid=1078601).
*ROI: You spend $10 to save $7,000+.*
